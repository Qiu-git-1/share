'''
The Python code contains two classes, kNN_shrunk_l1 and kNN_shrunk, which implement k nearest neighbors (kNN) based on L1 distances, respectively.
Algorithm and kNN algorithm based on covariance contraction. The main purpose of this code is to perform a near neighbor search on high dimensional data, and you can choose whether to do it or not
Bleaching treatment to reduce noise and improve performance.

Here is a detailed description of each class:

kNN_shrunk_l1
This class uses the NearestNeighbors class from the Scikit-learn library to implement the kNN search. It accepts L1 distance as a metric,
And it can run on the CPU.
The -__init__ method initializes the kNN classifier and can choose whether or not to whiten the data.
The -train method is an empty method, and no training process is actually required in this type of kNN implementation.
The -score method calculates the distance between a given source data and the training dataset and can return an index of the nearest neighbors.

kNN_shrunk
This class uses the Faiss library to implement kNN search and supports GPU acceleration. It can handle vector data or higher dimensional data, and can choose
Whether to whiten or not.
The - __init__ method initializes the Faiss index, which can be either a CPU index or a GPU index, and can choose whether to whiten the data.
The -train method is also an empty method because the Faiss index is already created at initialization.
The -score method uses the Faiss index to calculate the distance between the source data and the training dataset, and can return the index of the nearest neighbor.
